description: Server-Side Rendering in @constela/start
---

`@constela/start` provides server-side rendering out of the box. Pages defined in JSON are automatically SSR'd on the server and hydrated on the client for optimal performance and SEO.

<Callout type="tip">
No additional configuration is required for SSR. Just create your JSON route files and the framework handles the rest.
</Callout>

## How It Works

1. When a request comes in, the server renders the page to HTML
2. The HTML is sent to the client with embedded hydration data
3. The client hydrates the page, making it interactive
4. Subsequent navigation uses client-side routing

## SSR Style Evaluation

Starting from `@constela/server` v4.1.0, style expressions defined in your JSON routes are evaluated during server-side rendering. Define styles at the root of your program and use them in views:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "route": { "path": "/" },
  "styles": {
    "button": {
      "base": "px-4 py-2 rounded",
      "variants": {
        "variant": {
          "primary": "bg-blue-500 text-white",
          "secondary": "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800"
        }
      },
      "defaultVariants": { "variant": "primary" }
    }
  },
  "state": {},
  "actions": [],
  "view": {
    "kind": "element",
    "tag": "button",
    "props": {
      "className": { "expr": "style", "name": "button" }
    },
    "children": [
      { "kind": "text", "value": { "expr": "lit", "value": "Click me" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

The SSR output includes the resolved class string:

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue-500 text-white">Click me</button>
```

<Callout type="tip">
Style expressions are evaluated at render time, producing static class strings in the HTML output. This ensures consistent styling between SSR and client hydration.

## Benefits of SSR

- **SEO**: Search engines can crawl your content
- **Performance**: Faster Time to First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Accessibility**: Content is available without JavaScript
- **Social sharing**: Open Graph meta tags work correctly
