## What is Constela?

Constela is a **compiler-first UI language** designed for vibecoding. It provides a structured JSON-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) that AI assistants can easily generate and manipulate.

Unlike traditional UI frameworks that require complex build toolchains and deep JavaScript knowledge, Constela compiles declarative JSON definitions directly into optimized DOM operations.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "state": {
    "message": { "type": "string", "initial": "Hello, Constela!" }
  },
  "view": {
    "kind": "element",
    "tag": "div",
    "children": [
      {
        "kind": "text",
        "value": { "expr": "state", "name": "message" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Mental Model: Language vs Library

<Callout type="tip">
Think of Constela as a **language**, not a library. You describe what you want, and the compiler handles the how.
</Callout>

<CompareGrid>
  <CompareGrid.Column title="Traditional UI development">
    - Write JavaScript/TypeScript code
    - Import framework functions
    - Manage state manually
    - Handle DOM updates yourself
  </CompareGrid.Column>
  <CompareGrid.Column title="Constela approach">
    - Describe UI structure in JSON
    - Declare state and its types
    - Define actions declaratively
    - Compiler generates efficient code
  </CompareGrid.Column>
</CompareGrid>

## Constela's Vision

- **A Simpler, Intuitive Approach**: Constela provides an elegant way to build UI—describe what you want, and the compiler handles the rest
- **A Language, Not a Library**: With its own compiler and runtime, Constela transforms your intent directly into optimized code
- **Scales with Your Needs**: From simple widgets to complex applications, Constela's architecture grows with your project
- **Accessible by Default**: Compile-time checks catch common a11y issues before they reach production
- **Extensible**: Register custom functions via the plugin system to extend the DSL
- **Polished UX**: CSS-based enter/exit transitions for smooth conditional rendering

## When to Use Constela

Constela excels across a wide range of scenarios:

| Use Case | Why Constela Excels |
|----------|-------------------|
| **AI-generated UI** | Structured JSON is easier for LLMs to generate correctly |
| **Interactive applications** | Reactive state management with zero boilerplate |
| **Embedded components** | Small runtime footprint, big capabilities |
| **Rapid prototyping to production** | Start fast, scale confidently |
| **Complex state management** | Declarative actions simplify even intricate logic |

<Callout type="note">
Constela is particularly powerful when paired with AI assistants. The JSON-based DSL reduces hallucination and improves generation accuracy—while you maintain full control over complex application logic.
