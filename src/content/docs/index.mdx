## What is Constela?

Constela is a **compiler-first UI language** designed for vibecoding. It provides a structured JSON-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) that AI assistants can easily generate and manipulate.

Unlike traditional UI frameworks that require complex build toolchains and deep JavaScript knowledge, Constela compiles declarative JSON definitions directly into optimized DOM operations.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "state": {
    "message": { "type": "string", "initial": "Hello, Constela!" }
  },
  "view": {
    "kind": "element",
    "tag": "div",
    "children": [
      {
        "kind": "text",
        "value": { "expr": "state", "name": "message" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Mental Model: Language vs Library

<Callout type="tip">
Think of Constela as a **language**, not a library. You describe what you want, and the compiler handles the how.
</Callout>

Traditional UI development:
- Write JavaScript/TypeScript code
- Import framework functions
- Manage state manually
- Handle DOM updates yourself

Constela approach:
- Describe UI structure in JSON
- Declare state and its types
- Define actions declaratively
- Compiler generates efficient code

## What Constela is NOT

- **Not a React replacement**: Constela is designed for specific use cases, not general-purpose web development
- **Not a framework**: It's a language with its own compiler and runtime
- **Not for complex apps**: Large-scale applications with intricate state management are better served by established frameworks

## When to Use Constela

Constela excels in these scenarios:

| Use Case | Why Constela Works |
|----------|-------------------|
| **AI-generated UI** | Structured JSON is easier for LLMs to generate correctly |
| **Simple interactive widgets** | Minimal setup, no build complexity |
| **Embedded components** | Small runtime footprint |
| **Rapid prototyping** | Describe once, compile anywhere |

<Callout type="note">
Constela is particularly powerful when paired with AI assistants. The JSON-based DSL reduces hallucination and improves generation accuracy.
